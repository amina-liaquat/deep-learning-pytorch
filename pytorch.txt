Pytorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library that is mainly used for building and training deep learning models.
  
Fundamentally, PyTorch offers two high-level functionalities:

- Tensor computation (similar to NumPy) with strong acceleration support for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
- Deep neural networks with a tape-based autograd system (automatic differentiation)
